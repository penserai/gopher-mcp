# File system adapter — serve a directory tree as navigable content.
#
# Directories become menus, text files become documents.
# If a .gophermap file exists in a directory, it overrides the auto-generated menu.
# The extensions filter is optional — omit it to serve all files.
#
# Usage: cargo run -p gopher-mcp-server -- --no-tls --config examples/fs-demo.toml
