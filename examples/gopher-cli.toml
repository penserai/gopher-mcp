# Used by both CLI commands and the interactive TUI.
# The binary embeds the engine — no server needed.
#
# CLI examples:
#   gopher-cli-tui browse                     # list all namespaces
#   gopher-cli-tui browse feed.hackernews/    # browse a feed
#   gopher-cli-tui fetch feed.hackernews/entry/0  # read an entry
#   gopher-cli-tui search feed.hackernews/ "rust"  # search
#   gopher-cli-tui publish vault/note.md --content "hello"  # write
#   gopher-cli-tui                            # launch interactive TUI
#
# Remote mode — uncomment to connect to a running gopher-cli-server
# instead of using the embedded engine.
# Also settable via --url flag or GOPHER_CLI_URL env var.

# Gopherspace sources (live gopher servers on port 70).
# Used in the TUI GoTo popup and reachable from CLI browse/fetch.
