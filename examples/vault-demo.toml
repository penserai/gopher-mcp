# Agent vault — a writable namespace backed by the filesystem.
#
# The agent can publish, browse, fetch, search, and delete documents.
# Parent directories are created automatically on publish. Menus are
# regenerated from the directory structure after every write/delete.
#
# Usage:
#   cargo run -p gopher-mcp-server -- --no-tls --config examples/vault-demo.toml
#
# Then ask your agent to:
#   gopher_publish("vault/notes/idea.md", "# My idea\n...")  — write a note
#   gopher_browse("vault/")                                   — list folders and notes
#   gopher_browse("vault/notes")                              — list notes in notes/
#   gopher_fetch("vault/notes/idea.md")                       — read a note
#   gopher_search("vault/", "idea")                           — find notes matching "idea"
#   gopher_delete("vault/notes/idea.md")                      — remove a note
