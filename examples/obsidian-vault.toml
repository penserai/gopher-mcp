# Obsidian vault adapter — give an AI agent access to your notes.
#
# Markdown files become fetchable documents. Folders become browsable menus.
# The .md extension filter keeps binary attachments (images, PDFs) out of
# results, so agents only see text — saving tokens and avoiding noise.
#
# Usage:
#   cargo run -p gopher-mcp-server -- --no-tls --config examples/obsidian-vault.toml
#
# Then ask your agent to:
#   gopher_browse("vault/")              — list top-level folders and notes
#   gopher_browse("vault/Projects")      — list notes in Projects/
#   gopher_fetch("vault/Projects/idea")  — read a specific note
#   gopher_search("vault/", "rust")      — find notes matching "rust"
